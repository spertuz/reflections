* Viewing a diff between two files helped spotting bugs easily
* In the long term, having easy access to the entire history of 
a file I make can make me a more efficient programmer by helping
me identify my most common causes of issues
* VCS stands for Version Controol Systems
* With manual commits one takes the risk of forgetting to save
changes
* VCS like Git treat files jointly since coding projects are usually
comprised of several, inter-related files of code
* git log and git diff can be used to find differences between different
commited files
* Using version control can make me more confident by allowing me to reverse
to previous versions of my code
